# Design considerations

## Basics

A task may belong_to an org_unit and may belong_to a list. org_units and lists
are used for authorization. One or more lists may be used for grouping tasks
belonging to an org_unit. For projects or other org_unit independent purposes
create a list without assigning an org_unit.

Tasks without assigned org_unit nor list are private and only accessible for
the assigned user (owner).

## Models

### Task

### OrgUnit

### List

### TimeAccounting

Access to time_accountings is granted by authorization via org_unit or list
from the task the time_accounting belongs_to. If the task has no org_unit or
list assigned, only the owner of the task has access to the time_accounting
record.
